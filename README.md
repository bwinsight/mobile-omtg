Mobile Security - OMTG-Android Walkthrough

Mobile applications suffer from many forms of security vulnerabilities likewise other applications but require new approaches in security testing. OWASP OMTG Android challenges have been created as examples to demonstrate different vulnerabilites explained in the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/).

My solutions for these challanges have been published to help security researchers understand the fundamentals of mobile application security with examples.
