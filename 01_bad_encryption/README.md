# OMTG-Android - 01. Bad Encryption - Solution

> MSTG-CRYPTO-1: "The app does not rely on symmetric cryptography with hardcoded keys as a sole method of encryption."

**Summary of the challenge:** Identify the password by reading the source code and decrypt the hardcoded secret.

<br/>First, install the vulnerable OMTG mobile application to an Android test device using [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb):

```
C:\>adb install app-arm-debug-Android5.apk
Performing Push Install
app-arm-debug-Android5.apk: 1 file pushed. 4.1 MB/s (5810897 bytes in 1.344s)
        pkg: /data/local/tmp/app-arm-debug-Android5.apk
Success
```
<br/>

Then, open the APK file using [JADX-GUI](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) tool to obtain the Java source code. This tool can decompile Dalvik bytecode to Java classes straight from APK. Find the relevant class and method which handles the password validation.

The `verify(String str)` method is reponsible for the password verification, which can be found under the `sg.vp.owasp_mobile.OMTG_Android.OMTG_DATAST_001_BadEncryption` class:

```java
public static boolean verify(String str) {
        byte[] encryptedDecoded = Base64.decode("vJqfip28ioydips=", 0);
        byte[] userPass = encrypt(str);
        if (userPass.length != encryptedDecoded.length) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < userPass.length; i++) {
            if (userPass[i] != encryptedDecoded[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

Despite of the hardcoded password is a Base64 string, it is not possible to reveal the plain-text format, since the original secret was encrypted by the following method:

```java
 private static byte[] encrypt(String str) {
        byte[] bytes = str.getBytes();
        for (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {
            bytes[i] = (byte) (bytes[i] ^ Ascii.DLE);
            bytes[i] = (byte) ((bytes[i] ^ -1) & 255);
        }
        return bytes;
    }
```
<br/>

After, the user submits the password, the `encrypt` method is called to perform the encryption. Each character of the byte array containing the user's input, then this will be changed by bitwise XOR and bitwise AND operators through a for loop. 

The XOR logical operator denoted by `^` sign and returns bit by bit XOR of input values, so if corresponding bits are different it gives 1, else it gives 0. Take an example below:
```
1110100 (binary input 1)
0010000 (binary input 2)
-------
1100100 (binary result)
```
The AND logical operator denoted by `&` sign and returns bit by bit AND of input values, so if both bits are 1, it gives 1, else it gives 0. Take an example below:
```
00000000000000000000000001110100 (binary input 1)
11111111111111111111111111111111 (binary input 2)
--------------------------------
11111111111111111111111110001011 (binary result)
```
<br/>

There is a variable called `Ascii.DLE` which needs to be clarified before we move on. The value of this variable is `16` and it can be found in the [Guava: Google Core Libraries](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/base/Ascii.java) source code.
```java
public static final byte DLE = 16;
```
<br/>

Now everything is known to create a simple [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) script for the password decyption. We need the encrypted secret from the Java source code then, assign this base64 value to the `base64password` variable, after handle the decoded value as a byte array. Iterate through the array and manage to modify the characters by the XOR, AND operators in reverse order.

```python
import base64

base64password = 'vJqfip28ioydips='
encoded = bytearray(base64.b64decode(base64password))
for i in range(len(encoded)):
	encoded[i] = (encoded[i] ^ -1) & 255
	encoded[i] = encoded[i] ^ 16

print(encoded.decode())
```
<br/>

Execute the Python script to reveal the password:
